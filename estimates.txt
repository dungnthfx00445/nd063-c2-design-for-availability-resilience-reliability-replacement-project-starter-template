Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) Estimates

For the Multi-AZ, multi-region database configuration, here are the estimated recovery objectives:

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: ~1-2 minutes
   - Multi-AZ RDS automatically handles failover to the standby instance
   - AWS monitors and initiates failover when needed
   - No manual intervention required
   - Failover typically completes within 60-120 seconds

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage: ~15-30 minutes
   - Requires promoting the read replica in the secondary region
   - DNS propagation time must be accounted for (typically 5-10 minutes)
   - Application configuration updates may be needed
   - Manual intervention and verification required
   - Total process includes promotion time (~5-10 minutes) plus DNS changes

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: 0 (zero data loss)
   - Multi-AZ RDS uses synchronous replication
   - Standby instance is always up-to-date
   - Transactions are not committed until written to both instances
   - No data loss occurs during AZ failover

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage: ~seconds to minutes
   - Cross-region read replicas use asynchronous replication
   - Typical replication lag is seconds but can vary with load
   - Some data loss possible during failover, limited to most recent transactions
   - Replication lag can be monitored via CloudWatch metrics
   - Actual RPO depends on network latency between regions and database load
